Absolute Units:
These have a fixed size regardless of screen size or user settings.
•px (Pixels)
	Represents a single dot on the screen (a pixel).
	Commonly used; consistent across screens (though technically relative to device resolution).
•pt (Points)
	1pt = 1/72 of an inch.
	Mostly used in print stylesheets, not ideal for screens.
•pc (Picas)
	1pc = 12pt = 1/6 of an inch.
	Rare in web design; used more in print design.

Relative Units:
This scale based on other elements or settings.
•rem (Root em)
	Relative to the root element’s (<html>) font size.
	Example: If html { font-size: 16px }, then 1rem = 16px.
•em
	Relative to the current element's font size.
	Can compound if nested — e.g., 1.2em inside a 1.2em element becomes larger.
•% (Percent)
	Relative to the parent element's size (width, height, font size, etc.).
	Example: width: 50% means half the width of the parent.
